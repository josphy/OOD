HW04: FishWorld

Team members: Qingsheng Li, Haoshan Zou

The assignment is to create FishWorld implementation based on BallWorld implementation. 

The GUI can create 6 different types of balls, and dynamically combine any strategies. The balls can have 10 paint strategies to choose from. The animation
of balls are shown in the ball panel.

Strategy Types:
1. Straight: Balls goes in a straight line 
2. Breathing: Balls change radius while moving
3. Color: Balls change color while moving
4. Curve: Balls move follows a curve line
5. Drunken: Balls change direction while moving
6. Wander: Balls randomly go forward or backward

Paint Strategy Types:
1. Ball
2. Square
3. Ellipse
4. Rectangle
5. Fish1 : Fish with open mouth and long tail
6. Fish2 : Fish with shut mouth and short tail
7. SwimFish: Animated fish switching between Fish1 and Fish2
8. NiceFish: SwimFish with a black eye
9. SharkImage: Black Tip Reef image
10. PlanetImage: A random planet chosen from Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn

Structure of GUI:
1. North panel is our control panel. From left to right:
	1) Text field is used to type strategies. "Add to List" button add input strategies to both drop lists.
	2) "Make Ball" button is used to generate a ball whose type is in the top drop list, and paint as the drop list item in paint strategy panel. "Combine" dynamically create a strategy that is the combination of the strategies selected on top and bottom lists.
	3) "Make Switcher" makes a switcher ball that can switch strategy after generated. "Switch" button switches all swither balls to the type in the top drop list.
	4) "Clear All" button is used remove all the balls on the central panel.
	5) Text field is used to type paint strategies. "Add New" button add it to the drop list below.
2. Central panel is our ball panel which is used to show the animation of balls.

Steps to run the BallWorld GUI:
1. Type the name of a strategy such as "Straight" into the text field on the left. Clicking the "Add to Lists" button will then add it to the two drop lists under "Make Ball" button.
2. Type the name of a paint strategy such as "Ball" into the text field on the right. Clicking the "Add New" button will add it to the drop list below
3. "Make Selected Ball" will make a ball behaving as the strategy selected on the top drop list under "Make Ball" button, and appearing as the paint strategy selected on the paint drop list.
4. "Combine!" will dynamically create a strategy that is the combination of the strategies selected on top and bottom lists. The new strategy is placed back into both drop lists and can be used again for combining. For instance, add then combine "Curve" and "Breathing" to make a ball that curves and breathes.
5. "Make Switcher" will make a ball, initially, ones that go straight.  
6. Clicking "Switch!" will cause all Switcher balls ever made to switch behaviors to whatever is the selected strategy on the top drop list. Switcher balls made later will have the same behavior as whatever the previously made Switchers have.
7. Click "Clear All" to remove all the balls in the central panel.
