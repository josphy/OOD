HW01: Inheritance-based BallWorld

Team members: Qingyue Liu,  Haoshan Zou

The assignment is to create BallWorld implementation where the ball implementations are 
sub-classes of an abstract ball. The GUI can create 7 different types of balls. The animation
of balls are shown in the ball panel.

Ball Types:
1. StraightBall: Balls goes in a straight line. 
2. BreathingBall: Balls change radius while moving.
3. ColorChangingBall: Balls change color while moving.
4. CurveBall: Balls move follows a curve line.
5. DirectChangingBall: Balls change direction while moving.
6. GostBall: Balls show up in different location while moving.
7. WanderBall: Balls change to random velocity after touching the wall.

Structure of GUI:
1. North panel is our control panel:
	1). Text field is used to type ball types.
	2). "Make Ball" button is used to generate a ball whose type is in the text field on the central panel.
	3). "Clear All" button is used remove all the balls on the central panel.
2. Central panel is our ball panel which is used to show the animation of balls.

Steps to run the BallWorld GUI:
1. Open the project in the Eclipse IDE, and click the Run.
2. Type the ball type in the text field in the format "model.BallType", e.g. model.StraightBall.
3. Click "Make Ball" to generate the ball with animation according to its type in the central panel.
4. Click "Clear All" to remove all the balls in the central panel.
