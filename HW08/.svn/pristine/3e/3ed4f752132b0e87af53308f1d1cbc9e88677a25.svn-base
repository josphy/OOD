COMP 504 HW07: Remote task execution
Zheng You, Li Zhu

1. How to run the program?
There are two *.launch files in the root directory. Open the
"ClientConfig.launch" file and click the green button "Run" in the Toolbars to
start the client program. Open the "EngineConfig.launch" file and click the
green button "Run" in the Toolbars to start the engine program.


2. Describe what options are available and what your program is doing.
The GUI program is able to perform remote task execution and client-engine
communication.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Client Program:
On top of the client GUI program are 6 panels, Button, Remote Host, Send
Message, Add Task, Task, and Run Parameter panels separately.

Button Panel:
- Quit: Shut down the RMI system and quit the client program. Note when closing
        the client program with clicking the "Close" button on the upper left
        or upper right corner of the window has the same effect as clicking the
        "Quit" button.
- Clear: Clear the contents in the display panel. This is for better display
         when they are too many information displayed.

Remote Host Panel:
Enter the remote host IP address and click the "Connect" button to connect to
the remote engine server. The default IP address is the current machine's
IP address.

Send Message:
Type some messages in the text panel and hit "Enter" to send the message entered
to the engine server. When "Enter" is pressed, the message typed will be cleared
for the next message.

Add Task:
Type the _full qualified name_ of the task class to add to the task to the
client.

Task:
Choose one task from the top droplist and click "Execute" to perform the task.
The result will be displayed in the scroll panel below. Choose two tasks from
the two droplists and click "Combine" button to create a combined task and place
the combined task in the two droplists. The combined task can be executed as
an individual one and can be used to further create another combined task.

Run Parameter:
Type an argument in the text field for the task execution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engine Program
On top of the engine server program are Button and Send Message panels.

Button:
- Quit: Shut down the RMI system and quit the engine server program. Note when
        closing the engine server program with clicking the "Close" button on
        the upper left or upper right corner of the window has the same effect
        as clicking the "Quit" button.
- Clear: Clear the contents in the display panel. This is for better display
         when they are too many information displayed.

Send Message:
Type some messages in the text panel and hit "Enter" to send the message entered
to the client. When "Enter" is pressed, the message typed will be cleared
for the next message.

3. Task implementations
There are 3 tasks implemented in this project.
- DeterminePalindrome: Determine whether an input String is a palindrome.
  - input type: String
  - return type: Boolean
- GetSin: Calculate the sinusoidal value of a radian value.
  - input type: Double
  - return type: Double
- GetTime: Retrieve the current time of the engine server.
  - input type: Integer
  - return type: String

4. Test results
There are 12 tests performed for our client and engine server programs. All
tests are successful.
