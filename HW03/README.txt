HW03: Composite-based BallWorld

Team members: Haoshan Zou, Li Yang

The assignment is to create BallWorld implementation where the ball implementations are 
different strategies loaded into the same concrete ball class. The GUI can create 6 different types of balls, and dynamically combine any strategies. The animation
of balls are shown in the ball panel.

Strategy Types:
1. Straight: Balls goes in a straight line. 
2. Breathing: Balls change radius while moving.
3. Color: Balls change color while moving.
4. Curve: Balls move follows a curve line.
5. Drunken: Balls change direction while moving.
7. Wander: Balls randomly go forward or backward.

Structure of GUI:
1. North panel is our control panel:
	1) Text field is used to type strategies. "Add to List" button add input strategies to both drop lists.
	2) "Make Ball" button is used to generate a ball whose type is in the top drop list on the central panel. "Combine" dynamically create a strategy that is the combination of the strategies selected on top and bottom lists.
	3) "Make Switcher" makes a switcher ball that can switch strategy after generated. "Switch" button switches all swither balls to the type in the top drop list.
	4) "Clear All" button is used remove all the balls on the central panel.
2. Central panel is our ball panel which is used to show the animation of balls.

Steps to run the BallWorld GUI:
1. Type the name of a strategy such as "Straight" into the text field on the left. Clicking the "Add to Lists" button will then add it to both the drop lists.
2. "Make Selected Ball" will make a ball with the strategy selected on the top drop list.
3. "Combine!" will dynamically create a strategy that is the combination of the strategies selected on top and bottom lists. The new strategy is placed back into both drop lists and can be used again for combining. For instance, add then combine "Curve" and "Breathing" to make a ball that curves and breathes.
4. "Make Switcher" will make a ball, initially, ones that go straight.  
5. Clicking "Switch!" will cause all Switcher balls ever made to switch behaviors to whatever is the selected strategy on the top drop list. Switcher balls made later will have the same behavior as whatever the previously made Switchers have.
6. Click "Clear All" to remove all the balls in the central panel.
